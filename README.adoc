*Playground for WokeLang - Human-Centric Programming Language*

toc::[]

== Overview

WokeLang is designed to be human-centric, prioritizing readability, accessibility, and inclusive design in programming.

=== Key Features

* **Natural Syntax**: Read like natural language
* **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly output
* **Inclusive Naming**: Guidelines for inclusive code
* **Error Messages**: Helpful, non-judgmental errors

== Language Design

=== Natural Language Syntax

[source,wokelang]
----
-- Reads naturally
define greeting as "Hello, World!"
display greeting

-- Conditional logic
if user is authenticated then
    show welcome_message
otherwise
    redirect to login_page
----

=== Accessible Code

[source,wokelang]
----
-- Accessible output annotations
@accessible
@aria_label("User profile section")
component UserProfile:
    display user.name as heading level 1
    display user.bio as paragraph
----

=== Inclusive Guidelines

[source,wokelang]
----
-- Built-in inclusive naming suggestions
-- The compiler suggests alternatives:
-- "master/slave" -> "primary/replica"
-- "whitelist/blacklist" -> "allowlist/blocklist"
-- "dummy" -> "placeholder"

configuration:
    primary_server: "main.example.com"
    replica_servers: ["backup1.example.com"]
    allowlist: ["trusted.example.com"]
----

=== Helpful Errors

[source]
----
-- Instead of: "Error: undefined variable 'nam'"
-- WokeLang says:
-- "It looks like 'nam' hasn't been defined yet.
--  Did you mean 'name'? (defined on line 5)
--  Here's how to define a new variable:
--    define nam as your_value"
----

== Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
guix install wokelang
wokelang run greeting.woke
----

== Examples

* `accessible/` - Accessibility-focused examples
* `natural/` - Natural language syntax demos
* `inclusive/` - Inclusive coding patterns
